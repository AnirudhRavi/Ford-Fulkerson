	 	 	 ALGORITHM
	 	 	 _________
 

Iteration #1:

Path = 5 <-(10)- 2 <-(4)- 0
Bottleneck of path, b = 4
New flow, f = 4

Iteration #2:

Path = 5 <-(10)- 4 <-(8)- 0
Bottleneck of path, b = 6
New flow, f = 10

Iteration #3:

Path = 5 <-(4)- 4 <-(9)- 0
Bottleneck of path, b = 4
New flow, f = 14

Iteration #4:

Path = 5 <-(6)- 2 <-(6)- 4 <-(5)- 0
Bottleneck of path, b = 5
New flow, f = 19


	 	 	 MINCUT
	 	 	 ______
 
Edges from S (set of vertices reachable from source) to T (set of vertices not reachable from source) are:
0 - 1
3 - 4
Min-cut capacity = 19
Min-cut:
Set S = {0, 3}
Set T = {5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19}


	 	 	 MAX FLOW
